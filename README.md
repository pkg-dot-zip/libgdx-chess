## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
LibGDX-Chess is a multiplayer chess game made in Java, using LibGDX. This project was made in college for a networking assignment.

This application writes the entire List of ChessFields as an object and the chat messages as Strings. This is because we needed to use both
for the assignment, and I recommend real world applications to replace the object with a string in the Forsyth‚ÄìEdwards Notation (FEN).
